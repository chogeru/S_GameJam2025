This extra tool provides you a way to create AnimationClips based on your Marker Profiles. 

It has two functions:
- Creating new AnimationClips:

- Adding Markers from a Marker Profile to an existing AnimationClip:


Each Marker in the profile will be added as a keyframe to the AnimationClip. The keyframe will be placed at the time of the Marker in the profile.
